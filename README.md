# UW Wifi Heatmap

This open-source project will provide a leaflet map visualizing live wifi usage data at the University of Waterloo main campus. It is neat.

Currently in very early development stage, don't expect anything to work yet!

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Awesome! I've added some development scripts to make it easier to get up and running.

## Development Environment

### Initial setup

You must have npm and node installed to run the development environment.

1. Fork or clone the repo.

2. `npm install`.

3. `npm install -g http-server`

4. `npm run build`

### Running development server

`npm run start`

The test server will run at `http://localhost:8080`. The public folder will rebuild automatically as you make changes in the source directory (You still have to manually refresh the page).
